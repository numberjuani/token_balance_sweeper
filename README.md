# token_balance_sweeper
1. This repo will obtain all known tokens from coingecko, filter by the user selected platform, and then obtain balances. 
2. You will need a high perfomance node that is not throttled because it is thousand's of requests at a time.
3. It is helpful for EOD reporting of holdings, specially if you need the balance at specific point in time, for example 1600 America/New_York
